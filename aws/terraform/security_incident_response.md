# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures to be followed in the event of a security incident affecting the Job Matching API infrastructure. It provides a structured approach to identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from security incidents.

## Incident Classification

Security incidents are classified based on their severity and potential impact:

| Level | Classification | Description | Response Time | Notification |
|-------|---------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| P1    | Critical      | Severe impact on production systems, data breach, or unauthorized access to sensitive data | Immediate (within 15 minutes) | Executive team, security team, affected customers |
| P2    | High          | Significant impact on production systems or potential data exposure | Within 1 hour | Security team, affected service owners |
| P3    | Medium        | Limited impact on non-critical systems or potential security vulnerabilities | Within 4 hours | Security team |
| P4    | Low           | Minimal impact, informational findings | Within 24 hours | Security team (ticket only) |

## Incident Response Team

The Incident Response Team consists of the following roles:

1. **Incident Commander (IC)**: Coordinates the overall response effort
2. **Security Lead**: Provides security expertise and guidance
3. **Technical Lead**: Handles technical investigation and remediation
4. **Communications Lead**: Manages internal and external communications
5. **Legal Counsel**: Provides legal guidance and compliance oversight
6. **Executive Sponsor**: Makes high-level decisions and provides resources

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Preparation

Preparation is ongoing and includes:

- Maintaining this incident response plan
- Regular security training for all team members
- Implementing and maintaining security monitoring tools
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Establishing communication channels for incident response

### 2. Detection and Analysis

Detection may occur through:

- AWS GuardDuty findings
- AWS Security Hub alerts
- AWS Config rule violations
- CloudWatch alarms
- IAM Access Analyzer findings
- Manual reporting by team members or users

When a potential incident is detected:

1. The initial responder logs the incident in the incident management system
2. The incident is classified based on severity
3. The Incident Response Team is assembled based on the classification
4. The Incident Commander establishes a dedicated communication channel

### 3. Containment

Immediate containment actions may include:

- Isolating affected systems by updating security groups
- Revoking IAM credentials or access keys
- Suspending compromised user accounts
- Blocking suspicious IP addresses at the WAF level
- Disabling affected services temporarily

Long-term containment involves:

- Patching vulnerabilities
- Updating configurations
- Implementing additional security controls

### 4. Eradication

Eradication involves removing the threat from the environment:

- Removing unauthorized access points
- Deleting malicious code or unauthorized resources
- Rotating all potentially compromised credentials
- Rebuilding affected systems from known good sources
- Restoring data from clean backups

### 5. Recovery

Recovery involves restoring systems to normal operation:

- Verifying that systems are clean and secure
- Gradually restoring services with enhanced monitoring
- Performing security validation before full restoration
- Monitoring for any signs of recurring issues

### 6. Post-Incident Analysis

After the incident is resolved:

1. Conduct a post-incident review meeting
2. Document the incident timeline and response actions
3. Identify what worked well and what could be improved
4. Update security controls and procedures based on lessons learned
5. Update this incident response plan as needed
6. Share relevant lessons with the team (without sensitive details)

## Specific Incident Response Procedures

### AWS GuardDuty Finding Response

1. Review the finding details in the GuardDuty console
2. Verify if the finding is a true positive or false positive
3. For true positives:
   - Identify the affected resources
   - Implement containment measures specific to the finding type
   - Document the investigation and actions taken
4. For false positives:
   - Document the reason for classification as a false positive
   - Update detection rules or create suppression rules if appropriate

### Data Breach Response

1. Identify the scope of the breach (what data was accessed)
2. Contain the breach by revoking access and isolating affected systems
3. Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
4. Notify legal counsel and executive leadership immediately
5. Prepare customer notifications in accordance with legal requirements
6. Implement remediation measures to prevent similar breaches

### Unauthorized Access Response

1. Identify the compromised accounts or access methods
2. Revoke access immediately and rotate all potentially affected credentials
3. Review access logs to determine the scope of unauthorized activity
4. Implement additional authentication controls if necessary
5. Monitor for any persistent access attempts

### Malware or Cryptomining Response

1. Isolate affected instances immediately
2. Capture memory and disk images for forensic analysis if possible
3. Terminate and replace compromised instances
4. Review security groups and network ACLs for unauthorized changes
5. Scan other systems for similar infections

## Communication Guidelines

### Internal Communication

- Use the established incident response communication channel
- Provide regular updates on the incident status
- Document all actions and findings in the incident management system
- Maintain confidentiality and share information on a need-to-know basis

### External Communication

- All external communications must be approved by the Communications Lead and Legal Counsel
- Provide clear, accurate information without technical jargon
- Focus on what is being done to address the incident and protect customers
- Follow regulatory requirements for breach notifications
